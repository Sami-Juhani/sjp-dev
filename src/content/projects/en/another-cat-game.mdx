During my first year of studies, I created a fun little cat game using
JavaScript. This project helped me learn JavaScript syntax and improve my
overall programming skills. The game is almost complete; it only lacks sound
effects and a proper ending to wrap it up.

## Features

- **Score System**: Tracks the player's progress and performance throughout the
  game.
- **Health and Stamina Bars**: The cat cannot attack if its stamina falls below
  a certain threshold.
- **Two Types of Attacks**: The cat can perform two different types of attacks,
  each with unique effects.
- **Variety of Enemies**: Different types of enemies, each with varying health
  levels, make gameplay challenging.
- **Loot**: Enemies drop health refills and special ability items upon defeat.
- **Special Ability**: The cat transforms into a spinning fireball after
  collecting three special ability items.
- **Idle Timer**: The cat falls asleep if left idle for a certain period of
  time.

## Technologies

- **JavaScript**: Used for the entire development process, from game logic to
  rendering interactions.
- **State Design Pattern**: Implemented to manage player states and actions
  efficiently.
- **Physics Mechanics**: Simple physics systems were modeled to simulate cat
  movements and attack dynamics.

## Personal Development

Through this project, I advanced my JavaScript programming skills significantly.
Developing an interactive game was especially exciting. For instance,
implementing the State Design Pattern to handle player states and creating the
physics mechanics were excellent learning experiences. These challenges enhanced
my understanding of how to manage game logic efficiently.

## Conclusion

This cat game project offered a fun and engaging way to deepen my knowledge of
JavaScript while exploring basic game development concepts. The interactive
nature of the game, along with its unique mechanics, made it an excellent
learning tool. Although the project is not fully finished, it serves as a strong
foundation for future game development projects.
