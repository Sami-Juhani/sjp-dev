This project is an e-commerce web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB,
Express, React, Node) stack. The idea behind this project was to address the
growing demand for energy-efficient solutions in the e-commerce space. We
adopted agile methodologies and employed the Scrum framework throughout the
development process.

## Features

- **Fully Functional E-commerce Platform**: A complete online store with product
  listings, filtering, and shopping functionalities.
- **User Registration**: Includes a password strength indicator that updates in
  real-time.
- **Product Filtering**: Users can filter products based on categories or
  perform text-based searches.
- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures secure login and authentication of users.
- **Shopping Cart with Preview**: Allows users to view a quick preview of their
  cart before checkout.
- **Favorites**: Users can like products and save them to a favorites list.
- **Multi-step Checkout Process**: A structured, multi-phase checkout experience
  for users.
- **Order/Receipt Storage**: All orders and receipts are stored in the database
  for future reference.

## Technologies

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing product, order, and user information.
- **Express**: Backend framework to handle API requests and route processing.
- **React**: Frontend framework used to build a responsive and dynamic user
  interface.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment used for server-side development.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens used for authentication and user session management.
- **Nodemailer**: Library used for sending emails, such as order confirmations.

## Personal Development

During this project, I learned a lot about setting up an e-commerce platform and
applying Scrum methodologies in software development. My programming skills,
particularly in React and Node.js, improved significantly. I gained hands-on
experience in both frontend and backend development, including working with JWT
for authentication and utilizing Nodemailer for email functionalities.

## Conclusion

This e-commerce application provided a comprehensive experience in full-stack
development using the MERN stack. The project offered valuable insights into the
entire software development lifecycle, from planning and coding to deployment
and testing. The practical experience with both frontend and backend
technologies will be useful for future web development projects.
