This project is an airport simulation application that models the effect of
different service desk configurations and operation times on the overall
functionality of an airport. It was developed as part of a school project,
emphasizing both programming and simulation methodologies to predict outcomes in
complex systems.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: The simulation includes an intuitive UI built
  with JavaFX, allowing users to interact with and visualize the simulation
  data.
- **SQL Database Integration**: All output data is stored in an SQL database for
  analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Simulated outcomes are displayed using visual graphs
  and charts to help identify trends.
- **Database Connection Indicator**: The application shows a live indicator of
  the status of the database connection.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Users can customize desktop configurations to
  explore various outcomes based on different service desk setups.

## Technologies

- **Java**: The core programming language used for the project, chosen for its
  robustness and versatility.
- **JavaFX**: Java's GUI framework was used to create the user interface and
  display simulation results visually.
- **SQL**: A structured query language database was employed to store simulation
  results for further analysis.
- **NetBeans**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used during the
  project for coding, debugging, and testing.

## Personal Development

Through this project, I gained practical experience with Java programming, which
was particularly useful given my growing interest in frontend development. It
also greatly facilitated my learning of TypeScript. Additionally, this project
helped me understand how software development can simulate real-world scenarios
and predict outcomes that might take years to observe in reality, thus providing
a significant advantage to businesses.

## Conclusion

This airport simulation project provided an excellent opportunity to dive deeper
into software development and system simulation. By investigating various
configuration scenarios and operation times, it demonstrated the potential
impact of small operational changes on large systems, such as airports. The
practical experience gained with Java, SQL, and JavaFX significantly contributed
to my overall programming skills and understanding of system behavior in
simulated environments.
