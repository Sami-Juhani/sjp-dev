This project is a music recommendation application that uses machine learning to generate song recommendations based on a user's playlist from the Spotify API. The app was developed as part of a school project, focusing on both the coding and the complete software development lifecycle (SDLC) while employing Scrum methodology.

## Features

- **User Signup**: Allow users to create accounts and sign in.
- **Spotify Playlist Integration**: Fetch user playlists from the Spotify API.
- **Song Recommendations**: Generate song recommendations based on cosine similarity of playlist vectors.
- **Music Player**: Features play, pause, next, previous, and seek functionalities.
- **Localization**: Supports multiple languages, including English, Farsi, Finnish, French, Japanese, and Russian.
- **Song Reviews**: Users can review songs with 0-5 stars, stored in the database.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Python was a natural choice for the machine learning-based application due to its extensive machine learning libraries.
- **Scikit-learn**: Python's machine learning library used to create playlist vectors.
- **Django**: Backend that handles API requests and serves the application.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Spotify API**: Integrated to fetch user playlists and track information.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, track ratings, and recommendations.
- **Jenkins**: Automating tests and deployment.
- **AWS**: The application was publicly available during the project using AWS cloud services (EC2, S3).
- **Docker**: The application was containerized with Docker for easier deployment.

## Conclusion

This music recommendation application demonstrated how machine learning can enhance the user experience by providing personalized content. By integrating the Spotify API and utilizing the scikit-learn library, this project offered an inspiring learning process. By going through all stages of the SDLC and employing the Scrum methodology, this project was a true exercise in real software development.
